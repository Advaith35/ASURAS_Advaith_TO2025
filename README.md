## 🚀 Overview

The AI Prescription Assistant is an end-to-end voice-driven solution designed to *streamline doctor-patient workflows*. This project tackles two major problems in Indian healthcare:  
1. *Overburdened doctors* who waste time on handwritten prescriptions  
2. *Patients with low adherence* due to language and literacy barriers  

Using *Generative AI, we empower doctors to speak and generate digital prescriptions instantly, and patients to receive **timely reminders and clear dosage instructions*—in their local language.
